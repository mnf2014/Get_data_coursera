The final_file.txt corresponds to a table with information about the mean and standard deviation values of the different measures performed in the study above mentioned. This file has 81 columns and 180 rows.

Variables(columns)

In the work developped by Ghio et al., it was taken a group of 30 volunteers, for each one 6 activities were performed and for each activity several measurements were taken.

In the data set final_file.txt, the persons correspond to the column named subject (column 1)
                 the activities correspond to the column named activity (column 2) and were clasified as: 
 
 WALKING
 WALKING_UP
 WALKING_DO
 SITTING
 STANDING
 LAYING

From column 3 to column 81 we have the mean and standard deviation of the different measurements performed in each cartesian coordinate (x,y,z). The prefix t or f correspond to time or frequency.

The final_file.txt has 180 rows (30 volunteers x 6 activities=180) and 81 columns  (from 3 to 81 they are the mean value of the mean or standard deviation of the variables/measurements taken in the experiment).
